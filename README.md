As a Business Analyst in the Startup Medical Device industry, I've successfully led strategic initiatives, optimized operations, and fostered collaboration across diverse teams to achieve shared objectives. My unique perspective, honed through diverse roles in healthcare and emergency services, positions me as a valuable asset in translating complex data into actionable insights.

My expertise in research and analysis enables me to provide meaningful, data-driven insights that uncover crucial factors influencing business performance. I've played a pivotal role in enhancing organizational processes for supply chain logistics and sales operations, serving as the point of contact for creating and maintaining dashboards. This underscores my strong time management, attention to detail, and effective communication skills, catering to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

With a background spanning Emergency Medical Technician, Care Coordinator, Medical Assistant, and Medical Scribe roles, I bring a wealth of experience in navigating the dynamic and high-stakes environment of healthcare. This firsthand exposure has instilled in me a deep appreciation for the transformative impact of leveraging data on operational efficiency and decision-making processes.

In pursuit of excellence, I've undertaken professional certifications and continuous education in data and business intelligence analytics, complemented by applied projects. My technical proficiency includes advanced skills in Excel, SQL, and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI. This commitment to ongoing learning reflects my dedication to staying at the forefront of industry trends and technologies.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from UCSB and am a recent graduate of the Business Intelligence Analytics Professional Certificate program from TripleTen (formerly Practicum) Bootcamp. This unique blend of healthcare experience, analytical prowess, and a commitment to lifelong learning positions me as a versatile and insightful Business Intelligence Data Analyst ready to contribute to transformative projects in any industry.

I am open and eager to collaborate on impactful projects. Please reach out to me for open opportunities!
